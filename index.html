<h3 id="unc-charlotte---delta-sigma-iota-fraternity-inc">UNC Charlotte - Delta Sigma Iota Fraternity Inc.</h3>
<p><strong>Founding Father, Vice President</strong></p>
<p><em>Founded November 24th, 2019</em></p>
<p>In the fall of 2019, I was given the opportunity to co-found a chapter of Delta Sigma Iota on UNC Charlotte&rsquo;s campus. I never envisioned a fraternity in my future, but I&rsquo;m glad I said yes. Prior to founding the fraternity, I, along with five others I now call brothers, completed a rigorous pledge process. In doing so, we forged friendships that I hope will stand the test of time.</p>
<p>Founding, maintaining, and growing an organization like this comes with a plethora of responsibility. Given the expansive nature of our work and our dimunitive manpower, our titles have not come with the division of labor that bureaucracy ordinarily implies. While some work attributed to my name may have been unique, a majority of these duties have been shared among the six founders.</p>
<p>Responsibilities Include&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of an Internal Executive Structure</li>
<li>Creation and Ratification of Governing Bylaws</li>
<li>Leading Weekly Chapter Meetings</li>
<li>Social Media Oversight</li>
<li>Recruitment</li>
<li>New Member Education</li>
<li>Representing Fraternity at Greek Council Meetings</li>
